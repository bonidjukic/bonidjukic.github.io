I'm a self-taught, full stack web dev with 7+ years of experience, holding a master's degree in physics education, previously co-founded a small development agency of 7 people (working as a remote tech team for a US-based startup) and done a lot of freelancing and contracting.

I'm very passionate about software development, computers and technology in general. I like to write code, solve problems and have fun along the way.

## Tech stack

The technical stack I'm most comfortable with is Python, Django, Lua, PostgreSQL, Javascript. I also have some experience with Django Rest Framework, GeoDjango, Ansible, Docker, PHP, Symfony, Drupal, C#, Clojure.

I also have DevOps experience with Linux/Ubuntu, Docker, Ansible, Fabric, Supervisor, AWS S3/Cloudfront etc.
